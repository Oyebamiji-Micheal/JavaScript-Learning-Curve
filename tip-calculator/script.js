/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use ðŸ‘‡
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
*/

// Get global access to all inputs / divs here (you'll need them later ðŸ˜˜)
// bill input, tip input, number of people div, and per person total div
let billInput
let tipInput
let totalBill

// Get number of people from number of people div

// ** Calculate the total bill per person **
const calculateBill = () => {

  // get the tip from user & convert it into a percentage (divide by 100)
  tipInput = Number(document.getElementById('tipInput').value) / 100

  // get the total tip amount

  // calculate the total (tip amount + bill)
  totalBill = billInput + tipInput * billInput

  // calculate the per person total (total divided by number of people)
  numberOfPeople = Number(document.getElementById('numberOfPeople').innerText)
  perPersonTotal = totalBill / numberOfPeople

  // update the perPersonTotal on DOM & show it to user
  document.getElementById('perPersonTotal').innerText = `$${perPersonTotal.toFixed(2)}`

  // increment the amount of people
  // update the DOM with the new number of people
  // calculate the bill based on the new number of people

// ** Splits the bill between fewer people **

  // if amount is 1 or less simply return
  // (a.k.a you can't decrease the number of people to 0 or negative!)
